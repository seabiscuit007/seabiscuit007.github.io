        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why birds seem to be everywhere? The truth is, they're not real... they're surveillance drones sent by the government to monitor us. This website will prove it, one feather at a time. Did you know? Birds went mysteriously extinct in 1975. The government replaced them with advanced surveillance drones shaped like pigeons, sparrows, and crows. Don’t believe me? Have you ever seen a baby pigeon? Exactly.</p>
        <h3>Why Birds Are Watching You</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They have a bird's eye view.</li>
            <li>The ‘bird song’ you hear at sunrise is actually the sound of thousands of drones booting up. Nature’s alarm clock? More like Big Brother’s alarm clock.</li>
            <li>Why does a bird sit on a power line? To recharge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Proof</h2>
        <p>We analyzed 10,000 bird sightings and concluded that 87% of them were government agents in disguise. The other 13% were pigeons pretending to be government agents.</p>
        <li>Not all drones are created equal. Pigeons are for urban settings, seagulls cover coastal areas, and crows handle reconnaissance in rural zones. Need long-term surveillance? Deploy the Owl Overwatch—it sees you even at midnight.</li>
        <li>Watch out for hummingbirds! The government made them small to sneak into your gardens and patios. Look at them hovering… gathering ‘nectar’? Or gathering intel?</li>

        <h2>Drone Technology</h2>
        <p><strong>Model:</strong> Pigeon 3000</p>
        <p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> 45 minutes (unless the wind blows too hard)</p>
        <p><strong>In-flight Wi-Fi Signal Strength:</strong> 2/10 (But they’re working on it)</p>

    <section id="evidence">
        <p>Here’s how to know a government drone (aka ‘bird’) is onto you:
            1.	It stares at you too long. If a bird makes direct eye contact for more than 5 seconds, it’s probably scanning your face.
            2.	It follows you. Walk to another bench, another street, another city. The same pigeon is still there.
            3.	It poops on you. Classic deflection. You’ll be too distracted cleaning up to notice you’re being monitored.
            4.	It chirps when you talk. Are they just birds being birds? Or are they relaying your conversations in morse code?
            5.	It’s always near power lines. Recharging mid-shift. Obvious.</p>
