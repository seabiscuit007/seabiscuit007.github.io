        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why birds seem to be everywhere? The truth is, they're not real... they're surveillance drones sent by the government to monitor us. This website will prove it, one feather at a time.</p>
        <h3>Why Birds Are Watching You</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>They have a bird's eye view.</li>
            <li>They don’t eat—they just recharge.</li>
            <li>Why does a bird sit on a power line? To access their Wi-Fi network.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Proof</h2>
        <p>We analyzed 10,000 bird sightings and concluded that 87% of them were government agents in disguise. The other 13% were pigeons pretending to be government agents.</p>
